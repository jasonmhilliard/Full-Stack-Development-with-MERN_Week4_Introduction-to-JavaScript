The word document breaks down the fundamental building blocks of JavaScript code-  Variables, Arrays, Functions, Objects and Loops along with some small code examples for each that you can run in the developer tools in the browser console.

IV.  License
----------
The source material for this repository contains information and code from the MITxPRO Full Stack Development with MERN 32 week bootcamp course.
As a student in the course, I have participated in reading the course materials and created my own code throughout all of the course projects. As a result I have provided my own additions, comments, material and code to the repositories along the way.
